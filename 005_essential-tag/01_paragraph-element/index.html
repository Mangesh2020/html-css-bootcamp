<p>The local and national governments have an
    important role to play in ensuring the growth and improvement of microfinance.
    First and foremost, the market should be left to set interest rates, not the state.
    Ensuring transparency and full disclosure of rates including fees is something the government should ensure,
    and something that new technologies as well as reporting and data standards are already enabling.
